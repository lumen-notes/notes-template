# 📝 Getting started

This is your first note. Feel free to edit or delete it.

Not sure where to start? Click the calendar to go to your daily note and jot down whatever is on your mind.

Other things to try:

- [ ] Install Lumen as an app ([here's how](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Installing))
- [ ] Link to another note using `[[double brackets]]`
- [ ] Add your own properties to a note (check out the top of this note)
- [ ] Share Lumen with someone who might find it useful :)
